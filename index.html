  <h1><center>Hi, I'm Leo van Jaarsveld</center></h1>
  <p style="font-size: 16px; max-width: 800px; margin: 0 auto;">
    Thank you for visiting my website! I am currently interested in coding (because how else would this be here?) and playing the cello.
    A few of my favorite games include Detroit: Become Human, Red Dead Redemption and Horizon: Zero Dawn.
